# maze-solver

This project is a comprehensive robotics project that spans across algorithms, hardware, electronics, and simulation. The goal of the project is to develop a maze-solving robot that can navigate through a maze using various algorithms and sensors.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following major parts:

1. **Algorithms**: This folder includes the implementation of various maze-solving algorithms such as flood fill, depth-first search, and breadth-first search. The algorithms are responsible for determining the optimal path for the robot to navigate through the maze.

2. **Hardware**: This component involves the design and assembly of the physical robot. It includes the selection of motors, sensors, microcontrollers, and other electronic components required to build the robot.

3. **Electronics**: This component focuses on the electronic circuitry required to interface the sensors and actuators with the microcontroller. It includes the design of power supply circuits, motor drivers, and sensor interfaces.

4. **Simulation**: This component involves the development of a simulation environment to test the maze-solving algorithms before deploying them on the physical robot. The simulation environment mimics the real-world maze and allows for testing and debugging of the algorithms.
